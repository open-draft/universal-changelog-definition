## 1. Introduction

_Universal Changelog Definition (UCD)_ is a changelog format
designed for listing software changes in a form that both machines and
humans can understand.

### 1.1 Purpose

The purpose of UCD is to propose a unified format of a changelog, making it more predictable for the software consumers.

Below you can find a list of existing changelog conventions with their examples and areas that can be improved.

#### Conventional Changelog ([GitHub](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/conventional-changelog))

Conventional Changelog uses a set of defined prefixes to standardize changes. Those prefixes are useful for machines to generate a proper release version, for example.

However, since the format and the content of a change description remains abstract, the value of such changelog to the end consumer is in the hands of the software distributor. In other words, Conventional Changelog does not guarantee the quality of changes description, but ensures the changes are split into defined categories.

### 1.2 Intended Audience

UCD providers are software engineers responsible for the software.

UCD consumers are software engineers that consume the distributed software. UCD MAY also be consumed by an automated software for the purpose of listing the changes or guiding a human consumer through the software update process.

### 1.3 Intended Use

UCD is intended to be used as an artifact of any major/minor release of software.

### 1.4 Intended Scope

## 2. Overall Description

## 3. Specification

### 3.1 Format

UCD MUST be written in Markdown for the following reasons:

- Markdown document can be written by humans;
- Markdown document can also be generated by machines;
- Markdown document can be rendered in any major VCS provider (GitHub,
  GitLab, Bitbucket, etc.);

### 3.1 Categories

All release changes MUST be divided into the following categories:

- **Added**. New functionality introduced in the release. Bears mainly informatory character to the consumer.
- **Removed**. Entirely removed functionality that has no suitable alternatives offered by the software. Software consumer must treat this information to review their usage of the software and provide appropriate changes.
- **Changed**. Previously present functionality that has been changed.

### 3.x Declaration

#### Category: Changed

<Code code={changedImportExample} language="markdown" />

Each item of the Changed category:

- MUST include a change description represented by an arbitrary string;
- MUST include a diff code block illustrating the change;
